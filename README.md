unity-oculus-gameboy
====================



You can check out takohi's gameboy emulator here: https://bitbucket.org/takohi/unitygb/wiki/Home

You can download a build at my site http://shaneobrien.ie/prog/oculusGameboy.zip

Ideas:

Razer Hydra controlled Gameboy.

An 8 hour plane trip level, similar bus level.

Generated game shelf that scans which roms are in the folder.

Animated button presses, animated body model.

Gameboy addons, like the Light Boy.

Proper Gameboy (coin sound) start up screen.
